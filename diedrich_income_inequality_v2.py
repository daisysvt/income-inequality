# Paragraph about income inequality
st.write("""
üìä Income inequality in the United States is a complex and pervasive issue that has garnered increasing attention in recent decades. The wealth gap between the rich and the poor has widened, raising concerns about **economic disparities and social justice**. This phenomenon is not only evident in statistical measures but also has [real-world implications](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/us/politics/gao-income-gap-rich-poor.html), affecting access to education üè´, healthcare üè•, and economic opportunities üí∏.

üí∞ The consequences of income inequality extend beyond individual financial situations, influencing societal stability and overall well-being. Addressing these disparities requires a comprehensive understanding of the contributing factors, including [policy decisions](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2017/10/11/inequality-fiscal-policy-can-make-the-difference), systemic issues, and socio-economic dynamics. As we explore the relationship between state welfare policies and income inequality, it is **crucial to consider the broader context** of this multifaceted challenge.

# Paragraph about Gini coefficient
st.write("""
üìê One way to measure income inequality is the [Gini coefficient](https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-the-gini-coefficient). It represents the distribution of income among the residents of a country, providing insights into the economic disparity.
A Gini coefficient of **0 indicates perfect equality** (everyone has the same income), while a coefficient of **1 represents maximum inequality** (one person or group has all the income).""")

# Paragraph about differences in Gini coefficient between U.S. states
st.write("üí∞ Income inequality across U.S. states exhibits notable variations, and understanding these differences involves a complex interplay of economic, social, and policy factors. **One prominent factor influencing income inequality is the diverse landscape of public spending and welfare policies implemented at the state level.**")

st.write("üè¶ States with [robust public welfare programs](https://www.route-fifty.com/management/2021/09/states-weakest-social-safety-nets/185519/) and targeted spending on social services often experience lower levels of income inequality. These policies aim to provide a safety net for vulnerable populations, reducing the wealth gap and fostering economic inclusivity. üìö üè• For instance, states that invest significantly in public education, healthcare, and social assistance programs tend to see a more equitable distribution of income.")

st.write("üìâ Conversely, states with limited welfare policies may face higher levels of income inequality. Gaps in access to [quality education, healthcare, and social support](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/maped/storymaps/edinequality/) can contribute to disparities in economic outcomes. Additionally, variations in taxation policies and social assistance program effectiveness play a crucial role in shaping the income distribution within each state.")
